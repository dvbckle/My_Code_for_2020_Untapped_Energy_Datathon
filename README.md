# My_Code_for_2020_Untapped_Energy_Datathon

This is a placeholder for my notebooks used in the Untapped Energy 2020 DUC Datathon and a record of my work during the datathon.
Feel free to look and see my thought process.  The code was used to clean and merge data and to find and predict inventory of drilled and uncompleted wells over time.

Results fed a project vizualtion using Tableau which won the award for Best Visualization using Tableau at the datathon.  A PDF of the slide deck is included.

The data used for the datathon is subject to a user agreement and none of the data can be shared.  The data is not posted on this page.

Currently, the notebooks posted only contain raw code.  There is no output or results from running the notebooks with the original data.  If after clarification of the user license, results are allowed to be shown without distributing the data, a run set of notebooks will be posted.

Without access to the data, there is limited utility to anyone except other datathon participants who are familiar with the datathon objectives.
