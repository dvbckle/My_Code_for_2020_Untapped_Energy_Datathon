# My_Code_for_2020_Untapped_Energy_Datathon
Code used to clean and merge data and to find and predict inventory of drilled and uncompleted wells.

Results fed a project vizualtion using Tableau which won the award for Best Visualization using Tableau.

This is a placeholder for my notebooks used in the Untapped Energy 2020 DUC Datathon.  The data used for the datathon is subject to a user agreement and non of the data can be shared.  Currently, waiting for confirmation as to what can be posted in relation to my work: nothing, raw code, copies of executed Jupyter notebooks.
